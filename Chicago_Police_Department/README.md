crimes_csv.py is meant to be a helper function for pulling crime data from:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2/data

You can download all years information from the above URL and then use this helper function to pull out only the years you want.

Note: while the CPD updates the information on this spreadsheet often, they do not include latitude and longitude until later.
For records that include the latitude and longitude, you will probably have to use data from the previous year.
